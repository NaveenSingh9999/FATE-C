# FATE-C Universal Training System

## ðŸš€ Overview

FATE-C now features **dual training approaches**:

1. **`fatec.train()`** - Universal training function (NEW!)
2. **Traditional Trainer** - Full control approach (existing)

Both methods coexist and serve different needs.

## ï¿½ï¿½ Universal Training with `fatec.train()`

### Purpose
- Train models created with `fatec.build()` or `fatec.Sequential`
- Hide NumPy/backend loops from user
- Provide clean, universal training interface
- Support multiple backends and metrics

### Basic Usage

```python
import fatec as fc

# Build a model
model = fc.build("network", layers=[
    {"type": "Dense", "units": 128, "activation": "relu"},
    {"type": "Dense", "units": 10, "activation": "softmax"}
])

# Train it (one function call!)
trained_model = fc.train(
    model,
    data=train_X,
    labels=train_y,
    epochs=10,
    optimizer="adam",
    loss="cross_entropy",
    batch_size=32,
    metrics=["accuracy", "loss"]
)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Which?

### Use `fatec.train()` for:
- âœ… **Quick prototyping** - Get models running fast
- âœ… **Standard workflows** - Common training patterns
- âœ… **Consistent API** - Same interface for all models
- âœ… **Automatic metrics** - Built-in tracking and display
- âœ… **Beginners** - Simple, one-function approach

### Use Traditional Trainer for:
- âœ… **Research projects** - Custom training logic
- âœ… **Advanced optimization** - Custom gradient computation
- âœ… **Debugging** - Step-by-step control
- âœ… **Novel architectures** - Experimental setups
- âœ… **Performance tuning** - Fine-grained optimization

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

**FATE-C Universal Training System** provides:

âœ… **`fatec.train()`** - Simple, universal training function
âœ… **Traditional Trainer** - Full control approach  
âœ… **Both methods coexist** - Choose what fits your needs
âœ… **Seamless integration** - Works with entire FATE-C ecosystem
âœ… **End-to-end pipeline** - From `fatec.build()` to `fatec.train()`

**First true end-to-end ML pipeline in FATE-C!** ðŸš€
